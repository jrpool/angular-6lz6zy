Why CartService has both providedIn and providers?
Why Manage Data Set Up Component 3 routerlink not in []?
Try It Manage Data getItems() does not do what claimed
shipping.json uses manipulative prices ($x.99).
products.ts also uses dark patterns.

Acccessibility defects:
Link for product name (becomes link, but should initially not be)
4. only creates if
Button without block container
Nearly invisible focus indication
Checkout link not focusable because no href
Checkout link styled to appear as a button
in-app navigation product details template: h4 not a heading
Form input borders have insufficient contrast
Form inputs missing autocomplete
Absolute lengths
Wrond and invariant title
